## The Languages I Know

```TypeScript
console.log("Hello! I am a programmer. Why else would I be here in GitHub?");
```

```Python
def main():
  print("The languages you see in this section are TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C#, and C++")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

```C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
  void Start() {
    string templateLiterals = "create template literals";
    string typed = "a strongly-typed language";
    Debug.Log($"C# is cool. You can do stuff like {templateLiterals}, and C# is also {typed}.");
  }
}
```

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "I ordered them by preference, I guess." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Python is nice but I'm not so sure if you can do static typing .-." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "C# is fun because it is strongly typed, but some function names are weird, like Accumulate instead of Reduce..." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "C++, on the other hand, is a bit more difficult to program in..." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "That is why I use TypeScript, I guess";
  return 0;
}
```
