## The Languages I Know

```TypeScript
console.log("Hello! I am a programmer. Why else would I be here in GitHub?");
```

```Python
def main():
  print("The languages you see in this section are TypeScript/JavaScript, then Python, then C++")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "I ordered them by preference, I guess." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Python is nice but I'm not so sure if you can do static typing .-." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "C++, on the other hand, is a bit more difficult to program in..." << std::endl;
  std::cout << "That is why I use TypeScript, I guess";
  return 0;
}
```
