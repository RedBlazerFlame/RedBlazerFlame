## The Languages I Know

```C++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main() {
  for(ll i = 1ll; i <= 3ll; i++ {
    cout << i << "..." << endl;
  }

  cout << "C++ is KING" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

```TypeScript
console.log("Hello! I am a programmer. Why else would I be here in GitHub?");
```

```Python
def main():
  print("This is very fun to program in!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

```C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
  void Start() {
    string templateLiterals = "create template literals";
    string typed = "a strongly-typed language";
    Debug.Log($"C# is cool. You can do stuff like {templateLiterals}, and C# is also {typed}.");
  }
}
```

```Haskell
separator :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]
separator sep elem acc = elem ++ sep ++ acc

main :: IO()
main = do
    print(foldr (separator " ") "" ["Hello","World!"])
    print(foldr (separator " ") "." ["I","am","trying","to","learn","Haskell","but","it","is","quite","different","from","the","languages","I","am","used","to"])
```
